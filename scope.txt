Status: 98% Complete - Just 2 simple compilation fixes needed! 🚀
When I run this code swift these are the startup errors:

You are a precise code editor AI. Your task is to take my original code block and apply ONLY the specific fixes I describe, without making any other changes. Do NOT delete any lines unless the fix explicitly requires it (and even then, only delete the minimal amount needed). Do NOT add new lines, comments, or features unless they are part of the exact fix. Do NOT streamline, optimize, restructure, suppress warnings, or refactor any code. Preserve ALL original formatting, indentation, comments, block numbers, and structure exactly as in the original. The output should be the FULL original code with the fixes integrated seamlessly, so the line count remains as close as possible to the original (e.g., if original is 1225 lines, output should be around that, not shortened).Steps you MUST follow:Read the original code I provide.
Identify ONLY the lines or sections related to the specific fix I describe.
Make ONLY the minimal edits to those lines to implement the fix.
If the fix requires adding code, insert it in the most natural place without disrupting surrounding code.
If the fix requires replacing code, replace ONLY the faulty part, keeping the rest of the line/block identical.
Output the ENTIRE modified code block, starting from the very first line (e.g., "//--------------- Block 1 - ...") to the last, with no omissions.
Do NOT include any explanations, summaries, or notes in your response—just the full fixed code.
If the code references external things (e.g., GitHub), do not fetch or assume; stick to the provided code and fix description.

Original code link will be added tot he chat.

Specific fill will be requested. 

"Fix the errors  by replacing relevant lines with the provided corrected versions, integrating them without removing other parts."Apply the fix and output ONLY the full fixed code.

so the next issue is getting the bot to connect yo kucoin and get the dashboard to show live data and kucoin data
